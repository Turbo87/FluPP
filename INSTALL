Howto install flupp development environment
===========================================

install prm packages:
    fpc-2.2.0-0.i386.rpm
    fpc-src-2.2.0-071105.i386.rpm
    lazarus-0.9.24.0.i386.rpm

    svn co https://flupp.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/flupp flupp


Move into flupp source directory
Now enter
